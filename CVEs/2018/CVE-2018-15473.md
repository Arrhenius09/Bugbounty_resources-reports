#  OpenSSH User Enumeration (CVE-2018-15473)

## Description
CVE-2018-15473 is a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier for a security vulnerability that was discovered in OpenSSH, a widely used open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. The CVE identifier was assigned on August 14, 2018.

The specific vulnerability is related to the way OpenSSH handled authentication attempts. It allowed an attacker to perform a timing attack, which could be used to guess valid usernames on a targeted system. By observing the time it takes for the server to respond to authentication attempts, an attacker could gain information about whether a particular username is valid or not.

This vulnerability impacted OpenSSH versions from 5.7 to 7.7, and it was addressed in OpenSSH version 7.7p1 by introducing a fix that eliminates the timing side-channel that the attackers could exploit.

As with any security vulnerability, it's essential to keep your software and systems updated to the latest versions to mitigate potential risks posed by known vulnerabilities.
